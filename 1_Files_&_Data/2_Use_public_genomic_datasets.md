# Use Public Reference Datasets

### What is this
- Google Cloud Genomics provides a variety of public datasets that you can access for free and integrate into your research jobs
    - An example is the 1000 Genomes dataset - [link](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/public-datasets/1000-genomes)
    - Google hosts these datasets and provides public access to the data via as BigQuery datasets or Cloud Storage buckets.
    - The Broad Institute and Google host the `Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)` - [link](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and shown below.  This is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators, with the goal of aggregating and harmonizing both exome and genome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and making summary data available for the wider scientific community.

### Why do this
 - USE a reference file in genomic cloud-based analysis
 - SAVE time by using a reference file that is already available in the cloud (no need to upload)

### Key considerations
 - Google adds more reference files as they become available
 - Many public healthcare or genomic datasets are listed in the [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset&filter=category:health)

### How to do this
 1. Interactive (queryable) access is available in the BigQuery console. You can explore variant calls in case/control & cohort analysis. There are sample queries to help you get started. [GO TO CLOUD GENOMICS DATASETS IN BIGQUERY](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/project/genomics-public-data). An example of currently available public genomic dataset in BigQuery shown below

 2. Read / Copy file access is available from Cloud Storage. Files are available in BAM, VCF, or FASTA formats. 
    - To access these public files, you can use a number of GCP services (such as Compute Engine VMs), or tools such as Terra.bio from The Broad or others.
        - Go to the [public REFERENCE Files](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/genomics-public-data/) cloud storage bucket
        - Go to the [public ANNOTATION Files](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcs-public-data--genomics/human-variant-annotation) cloud storage bucket
        -  USE the `htsget` protocol to access genomic datasets stored in GCS - [link](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/how-tos/reading-data-htsget), used for larger-sized datasets (optimization for access speeds)

### How to verify you've done it
 - REFERENCE the file in a BigQuery query or a VM-based analysis
