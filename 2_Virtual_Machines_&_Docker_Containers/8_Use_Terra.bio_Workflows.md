# Use Terra.bio Workflows

### Why do this

 - USE bioinformatics tools (GATK, Hail...) in Terra workflows on GCP
 - RUN scalable analysis on GCP without manually configuring Cloud Storage & VMs (or container clusters)
 - READ - [Getting Stated with GATK via Terra Workspaces](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=24102)
 - UNDERSTAND job overhead on GCP using Job Manager tools in Terra
 
### What is this
 
 Use Terra workflows for analysis - architecture and flow of researcher actions is shown belown

[![terra-wk-arch](/images/terra-wk-arch.png)]()
 
 Workflows use GCP Virtual Machine and Cloud Storage buckets.  Create your own workflows, or use example, pre-configured workflows. These can implement standard bioinformatics tools, such as [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) - shown below, or [Hail](https://hail.is/). Workflows can also use your own custom tools.

### Key considerations
- IMPLEMENT Terra best practice workflows --or--
- CREATE your own tools and workflows   
    - CREATE docker containers for your custom scripts or tools
    - WRITE WDL scripts for your custom tools / workflows 
- CONFIGURE input data and output data for both pre-created and custom workflows
- CONSIDER costs 
    - Terra workflows use resources from GCP and The Broad Institute 
    - From GCP, Terra uses Compute Engine, Google Pipelines/Genomics API, Cloud Storage and other services
    - Terra includes a UI called `Job Manager` that helps you understand the overhead on GCP of running your jobs

### How to do this

See example screenshots below for Terra Workflows.    
- **LOGIN** -> 
  - NAVIGATE to [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/) --> 'Try Terra' and authenticate with your email
   - USE $300 USD in GCP credit when you first try out Terra
- **SELECT DATA** -> 
  - USE reference public data (Terra Library -> Data)
  - UPLOAD your own research data for analysis (Your Terra Workspace -> Data Section)
  - REFER to data in Cloud Storage (use gs://{mybucket}/{my folder}) in your job parameters
- **IMPORT or CREATE WORKFLOW** ->  
  IMPORT (or clone) and configure an existing workflow from Terra or from [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/).  Alternatively, you can create and configure your own workflow.

  - RUN a [blastn WDL workflow](https://dockstore.org/workflows/dockstore.org/lynnlangit@gmail.com/blastn:5?tab=info) registered in Dockstore on a Terra Workspace.  See Dockstore screen below.

### How to verify you've done it
 For a Terra Workflow/Tool run do the following:  
    - CLONE an existing workflow or import a workflow (using **'Find a Tool'**) that you created from Dockstore or Broad Methods Repository, shown below  
     - ADD your data  
     - CONFIGURE the workflow / tool - shown below  
     - CLICK 'run analysis'  
     - REVIEW job history - shown below   

  Click 'Find a Tool' on the Terra Workflows tab to use tools or workflows that others have created 
   [![find-tool](/images/Find-tool.png)]()
  Configure your workflow or tool in Terra.  This example uses a bamstats workflow from Dockstore

  Run your job and review the job history in Terra

### Other Things to Know

Terra runs on GCE VMs & the GCP Genomics/Pipelines API.
Terra is the next generation of The Broad Institute's Firecloud tool. Shown below is a conceptual diagram of a Terra workspace.  
 [![terra-concepts](/images/terra-concepts.png)]()

 - Key Terra concepts:
    - **Workspace** -> container for workflow(s)
    - **Workflow** -> container for tool(s) and configuration, written in WDL for cromwell, JSON for parameters
    - **Tool** -> docker container image of your research script or binary tool and configuration in WDL
    - **WDL** -> [workflow definition language](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl), dialect required for configuring [cromwell orchestration engine](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell), as in 'a WDL file'
    - **Data** -> there are serveral types of data, when you create a workspace Terra creates an associated GCS bucket (name starts with `gs://fc-nnnnnn-nnnnnn-nnnnn...` . Also you can reference data in any GCS bucket to which you assign GCS IAM permissions (i.e. `gs://<myBucket>/...`) 
     - **Table Inputs** -> this is the data (files) that you will be analyzing in your pipeline
       - You can reference this data using the path to the GCS bucket, (i.e. `gs://<bucketName>/<fileName>) --or--
       - You can reference this data using a pointer to the GCS bucket path, i.e. (`this.myInputFile`)
       More about the Terra Data Model - [link](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/discussion/9769/data-model)
         - Participant -> a person enrolled in a study
         - Sample -> a biological sample collected from a participant
         - Pair -> represents a pair of biological samples collected from a participant
         - Set -> group of Participants, Samples or Pairs
     - **Reference Data** -> genomic reference data, i.e. `b37human`
     - **Workspace** -> workspace parameters, i.e. path to dockerfile, variable values, etc..., i.e. (`worskpace.myDocker`)
     - **Configuration Data** -> WDL and JSON files
