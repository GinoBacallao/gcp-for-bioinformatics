# Use Cromwell & WDL to build workflows

### Why do this
 - USE the open source [cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) orchestration engine to scale your analysis job(s) on the public cloud or to other locations (i.e. HPC...)
 - USE the open source [WDL (workflow definition language)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl) to configure the cromwell orchestration engine 
   - Use WDL scripts to configure your tool/workflow inputs & outputs
      - Common tools include the following:
         - GATK
         - HAIL
         - Picard
         - Custom tools or scripts
   - Use WDL scripts to configure execution environments (i.e. local, public cloud...) & resources allocated for each execution.  
      - Configurable resources include the following:
         - Docker container image locations
         - Task batch sizes
         - VM configuration (CPU, RAM, pre-emptible..)
         - and many other settings

 Conceptual workflow pattern is shown the the right.  Note the use of docker container images as well.  It's common to use bioinformatics tools, such as GATK or Hail with cromwell in pipelines. 

### What is this
 - Scaling Compute Engine Virtual Machine instances w/Google Life Sciences API, cromwell orchestration using WDL language. NOTE: Google Life Sciences API was called Google Genomics/Pipelines API previously.
 - NOTE: WDL/Cromwell documentation uses the words 'workflow' or 'pipeline' to define a series of tasks run for an analysis
 - WDL (Workflow Definition Language) script concepts are shown below 
   - READ WDL documentation - [link](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/documentation/quickstart)

### Key considerations
 - USE cromwell with Google Life Sciences API to manage the GCE (VM) resources for your analysis job with fewer manual configuaration steps
 - USE WDL scripts to configure the workflow inputs and outputs (for each bioinformatics tool used)
 - REFERENCE your scripts, jar files or docker container images for each of the bioinformatics tool used in your workflow
 - USE JSON files to configure the input/output parameters for each tool and also for EACH job execution

### How to do this
 - START with this 5 minute intro to cromwell & WDL - [link](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro/)
     - Be sure to put the cromwell jar file and the WDL file in the same directory
     - Verify that the cromwell version in the run command is the same as the version of the jar file you're using
 - [This tutorial](https://wdl-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted/TutorialOverview/#tutorial-scenario) shows running a multi-stage workflow on GCP
    - The workflow is **launched** with Google Life Sciences API
    - The workflow is **defined** using WDL
    - The workflow stages are **orchestrated** by cromwell
    - The workflow **runs** on multiple Compute Engine VMs
      - a master node is created for cromwell
      - cromwell submits each workflow stage as one or more **separate pipelines**

### How to verify you've done it
 - REVIEW the files in the output destinations (Cloud Storage buckets) to check they match the expected results
 - USE GCP Cloud Monitoring to monitor the overhead (CPU, memory etc...usage) for the Compute Engine VMs during job executions

### Other Things to Know
 - General GATK tool usage best practice guidlines from The Broad - [link](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/)
 - Cromwell can be run in '(run) stand-alone' or '(persistent) server mode'
    - VERIFY the version of Cromwell, WDL and tools when creating workflows (i.e. v44) - [link](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/download/44/cromwell-44.jar)
    - USE the 'wdl_runner' tool to run/test Cromwell workflows locally - [link](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl-runner)
    - USE the Broad's 'WOM tool' to validate WDL workflow syntax - [link](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/download/44/womtool-44.jar)
    - USE the Broad's Terra platform to run your workflow on a persistent Cromwell server using a web UI - [link](https:/terra.bio)
 - Cromwell is runnable in a variety of compute environments, see graphic below

    - [miniwdl check](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl#miniwdl-check) - a WDL linter
    - [miniwdl cromwell](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl#miniwdl-cromwell) - command-line interface for running a workflow locally using Cromwell
    - [miniwdl run](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl#miniwdl-run) - Operation is nearly identical to miniwdl cromwell. The invoking user must have permission to control Docker.
