# Use GCP for Virtual Machines & Docker Containers

In this section, you'll get information about using Google Cloud services to run VMs or docker container images.  You'll use Google Compute Engine VMs.  Also you'll use services for docker containers including Google Kubernetes Engine (or K8).  

Additionally you'll use bioinformatics pipeline & workflow APIs to coordinate VMs & containers.  You'll also see how to create a Notebook instance VM using a GCP template, so that you can use a Jupyter notebook for your analysis job.

Here are the topic pages in this section:

- Use Compute Engine Virtual Machines
- Use Jupyter Notebook VM Instance
- Use Terra.bio Notebook
- Test Docker Container Image for Pipeline
- Orchestrate Containers with GKE (Kubernetes)
- Use Google Life Sciences API (was Genomics API or Pipelines API)
- Use Cromwell and WDL for Pipeline
- Use Terra.bio Workflow
- Use Nextflow for Pipeline
- Use dsub for Pipeline
- Use Galaxy Project for Pipeline

The sections of the reference architecture outlined in red will be covered.

Bioinformatics APIs (or workflow languages) include the following: dsub, cromwell, Terra.bio and Nextflow. 

There are a number of possible ways to construct high volume data analysis workflows or pipelines on GCP with these purpose-built APIs.  In addition there is a specialized GCP API for Genomics workloads - it's called the Google Cloud Life Sciences API(was Genomics/Pipelines API).  

### Use a Map

An interactive representation (one view shown below) for several of the possible build paths for bioinformatics workflows on GCP is shown below.
