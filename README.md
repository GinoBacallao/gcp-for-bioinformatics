# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics

This repository shows how to use ☁️Google Cloud Platform public cloud services to scale **bioinformatics data analysis** tasks using best practices.  This use-cases are called any and all of the following: genomic-scale data workflows, pipelines or batch jobs.

This content is intended for researchers - in particular, this guide is for those who are **NEW to working with GCP**.  This Repo includes content you can read, watch or run:
