# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics

This repository shows how to use ☁️Google Cloud Platform public cloud services to scale **bioinformatics data analysis** tasks using cloud best practices for GCP.  This use cases featured as exampled are called any and all of the following: genomic-scale data workflows, pipelines, analysis or batch jobs.
